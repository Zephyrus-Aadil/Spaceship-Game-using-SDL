Steps to Run this spaceship game :
1) You need to have SDL installed in your system .
2) compile the code using ```g++ game.cpp -lSDL2 -lSDLmain -lSDl_image -o game```
3) If you already have installed SDL in your system then you can directly use my compiled binary
4) use `W` `A` `D` `S` to move the spacecraft
